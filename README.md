# capture-thing

Please see [the accompanying blog post](https://tyler.io/capture-thing/) for details.

Also, please note: the web browser capture feature is only setup to work with [Brave](https://brave.com/) currently. Reasons for that being:

1. Fuck Chrome.
2. Ugh, Safari, I want to you to be my daily desktop browser, but... *sigh*

That said, I'm happy to accept pull requests to add support for additional browsers.
